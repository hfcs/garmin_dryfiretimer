## Firearm safety

Even for dry fire, always make sure you remove ammo from your weapon and area around your dry fire training. Plus observe __Four Rules of Firearm Safety__.
1. Always treat every firearm as though it is loaded.                                           
2. Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction.
3. Keep your finger outside the trigger guard until ready to shoot.
4. Always be sure of your target and what is in front of it and behind it.
